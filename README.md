### Project Goals
#### Objective 
      To Build an AI based Face Recognition Model which Recognize the face and gives the access to the user
     
### Constraints
      For capturing the face, the person should be in light area and distance should be short otherwise Face detection won't allow the person to access
      
### Summary
      - The main objective of the project is capture the face and give the access to user, for this process we use deep face Library, face recognition, open cv , cmake , flask
      - Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual’s identity using their face. Facial recognition  systems can be used to identify people in photos,           videos, or in real-time.
      - Implementation of face recognition includes the following stages:
      - Data acquisition (capturing the face)
      - Input processing(Check it in the database of the system)
      - Face image classification (Analyze the capture image and database image)
      - Decision making(If it matches gives the access or if it is not there in the database, it save in the directory and give the access)
      - For access, in the monitor it shows the sign in and sign up option
      - While capturing the face it frames the face  with box for clear wavelength and providing the name of the person below the frame
      - And also it Captures the multiple faces at a time ,for that we using  “for loop” function

### Data Collection And Extraction
      - The data source is primary as we are also collecting the data by capturing our images
      - The authentication process starts with capturing the face from the webcam
      - The model uses face recognition and face detection
      - The model is then pretrained to register the new user

### Conclusion
•Face recognition is an emerging technology that can provide many benefits. Face recognition can save resources and time
•Face recognition systems are far from ideal to perform adequately in all situations form real world
•The project  aims is to  build  an  effective    attendance system  using  face  recognition  techniques.  The  facial recognition system will be able to mark the attendance via face Id. It will detect faces via webcam and then recognize the faces. After recognition,  it  will  mark  the  attendance  of  the  recognized person and update the attendance data to folder with name,time and date
•Capturing live images from camera and applying different techniques of face detection and face recognition which will reduce manual or traditional work
•And also time takes to login the system is fast because it encodes data automatically itself in background
